How to use
----------
	1. Remove any previous versions of "ProbeControlRoom" in your KerbalSpaceProgram/GameData directory
	2. Merge the downloaded "GameData" into your KerbalSpaceProgram directory
	3. Start the game and build a vessel with a ProbeCore
	4. Start the ControlRoom by:
	 a. MannedVessel: Bottom right, above the KerbalAvatars is a IVA button
	 b. UnmannedVessel: Use the CameraMode button (C) to access/leave IVA
	 c. Righclick the ProbeCore and click "IVA from here"
	 d. click the IVA button in the toolbar (if installed)

	 
Extended
----------
	On the first start a config file is created at GameData/ProbeControlRoom/Settings.cfg
	ForcePCROnly (default: False)
		forces the use of PCR
		- UI/Toolbar buttons to overwrite
		- Traps mapView and "Camera"-Key
	DisableWobble (default: True)
		disables the cameraShake when inside a PCR
	DisableSounds (default: False) [ALPHA - CurrentMethod (GameSettings-Volume) not stable]
		disables the Ship_Audio when inside a PCR
		- Seems to ignore Engines, Staging, Parachutes and similar, while explosions get muted.
		- With ForcePCROnly=True muting works, but always for every rocket with a PCR...
